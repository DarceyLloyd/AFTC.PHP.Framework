Got js includes? here they go...

If you require unique javascript on many pages of your website / web application I strongly recommend you structure as per your sitemap eg:

includes/js
	/page_or_module_name_1/include_file_name_1.js
	/page_or_module_name_1/include_file_name_2.js
	/page_or_module_name_2/include_file_name_1.js
	/page_or_module_name_2/include_file_name_2.js
etc
