Got css includes? here they go...

If you require unique CSS on many pages of your website / web application I strongly recommend you structure as per your sitemap eg:

includes/css
	/page_or_module_name_1/css_file_name_1.css
	/page_or_module_name_1/css_file_name_2.css
	/page_or_module_name_2/css_file_name_1.css
	/page_or_module_name_2/css_file_name_2.css
etc
