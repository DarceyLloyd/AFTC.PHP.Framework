	<h1>All For The Code</h1>

	<p>The AFTC has not had an update in over 3 years and the old code was getting a bit stale, it's time for an update!</p>

	<p>The new site will be running on the AFTC PHP Framework which is a PHP 7 relaxed MVC Namespaced PSR4 Framework, so once up and running it should be good for all my future needs for quite some time.</p>

	<p><b>All content will be coming back online gradually over the next couple of weeks.</b></p>

	<p><b>Back soon!</b></p>
