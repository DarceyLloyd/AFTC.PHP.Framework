NOTES:

- Got data to store for your website? XML? JSON? CSV? etc, store them here
- Got user account data that is not sensative? Dynamically create folders based on users id here and store their data in them
- Secure folders can be achieved by either working with a data folder outside of the http / web root folder of your server or use a htaccess file
